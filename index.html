      <p>Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I started this in July 2017 and hope to keep adding to it as time goes on.</p>
      <p>Here's an inspirational quote:</p>
      <p>We are part of this universe; we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts, is that the universe is in us.</p>
      <p>-Neil deGrasse Tyson</p>

      <p>That was me and my friend Elena at Girls Who Code Twitter. We were fooling around :)</p>
      <p>Girls Who Code was so much fun and I met so many good friends! And I learned how to code too, so extra bonus.</p>
      <p>I hope that we will all stay in touch. I'm pretty sure we will.</p>
